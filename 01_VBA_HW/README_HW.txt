You will find my final code for the VBA Module Homework. It is sheet agnostic and identifies unique tickers
then it runs through each worksheets data and pulls necessary values and outputs them on the "sumdog" sheet.

You may notice on my top_result.jpg the code stops running, that is likely because I am running a 32 bit excel version not 64.

conditional formatting is then applied. My solution goes through all workbooks necessary and spits out number *only* on the summary sheet.
